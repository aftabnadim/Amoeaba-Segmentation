Prior to analysis, the images were preprocessed by converting to 8-bit and applying a threshold (12, 255, raw). We used the "Analyze Particles" 
function to segment and quantify the A. castellanii cells, specifying that only particles larger than 40 pixels were counted. The output of this 
function was a CSV file containing the names of each image and the corresponding number of particles detected. 
The following code was used: 
 
 
run("8-bit"); 
setThreshold(12, 255, "raw"); 
run("Analyze Particles...", "size=40-1000 show=[Overlay Masks] display exclude clear summarize overlay");
